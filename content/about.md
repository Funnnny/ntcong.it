I'm a system engineer from Vietnam. In this blog I write mostly about my finding/tricks/anything about programming and security to improve my skills. I'm not a good writer *and* my English is bad but I'm trying write anyway. Maybe my posts are a little rough (or just plain bad), but no one actually reads it so who cares :)

My contact information is in the footer, drop me an email if you want to talk more about computer, or have some project I can contribute to (I love FOSS anyway).

Other than Vietnamese and English, I prefer to talk in Python and Go, and I'm a Vim (specially Neovim) user.
